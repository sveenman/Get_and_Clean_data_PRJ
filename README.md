Get_and_Clean_data_PRJ
======================
Accelerometer data analysis -- Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data

Repository name:
Get_and_Clean_data_PRJ

Data downloaded from:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The compressed file should be placed in the repository and unzipped.

Now the script "run_analysis.R" can be executed.

It will create a "testANDtrain_mean" (mean for each measurement)
and a "testANDtrain_sd" (standard deviation for each measurement).

Next, the script will write a csv file called tidy.
